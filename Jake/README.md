# AutoInsuranceClaimPrediction

This is a repository to show the process for predicting a claim amount of a
customer of automobile insurance. Unfortunately, some data is confidential
so all the sensitive parts are removed from the project; however, there is 
still a good amount of information on the exploration. This project was held
as an in-class competition (8 teams in total), and we got the 1st place.
